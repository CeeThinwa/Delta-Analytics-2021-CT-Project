## Abstract:

Kenya is a linguistically diverse country with over 40+ languages, but current NLP solutions serving her inhabitants do not capture this linguistic diversity. Furthermore, many Kenyans code-switch, particularly in informal settings and this requires a fresh approach to conducting NLP tasks on data generated by Kenyans.

The aim of this project is therefore to **build a Natural Language Processing solution for multilingual, code-switching cultures**, using sentiment analysis on Kenyan social media data as a use case. The data used was all tweets containing #KOT written during 1st June 2020 - 1st June 2021; #KOT is a hashtag that Kenyans on Twitter typically use to identify themselves. A problem-solving and project management framework, the *NLP toolbox*, was used to come up with this solution.
